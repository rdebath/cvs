CVS for OS/2
based on EMX 0.9c (patch 02)


This port works well in local mode.  It fully respects the OS/2
filename conventions, but only works on HPFS or other filesystem types
which support long filenames (like ext2fs or Netware FS with OS/2
namespace).  It does _not_ work on FAT partitions or any other fs which
does not support long filenames.  The port also works in client mode.

This port requires EMX 0.9c (patch 02) and the BSD libraries.  It should
work in local mode, in client mode and also in server mode.  nServer mode
will only work if the client uses the :server: method, because the CRLF
handling of IBM's RSHD.EXE is not "compatible" with CVS.  (If you find a
better rshd for OS/2, please let us know!)

To compile CVS for OS/2, you must install the following packages:

 - EMX 0.9c (patch 02) and the GNU-C-Compiler

      EMXDEV1.ZIP
      EMXDEV2.ZIP
      EMXRT.ZIP
      GNUDEV1.ZIP
      GNUDEV2.ZIP
      BSDDEV.ZIP
      EMXFIX02.ZIP

 - GNU make for OS/2

      GNUMAKE.ZIP

 - ufc.a (ufc-crypt) as a replacement for crypt (this may be something
   different if you live inside the USA).  I don't think you need this
   one currently, because the port of the server to OS/2 isn't done yet.

      GNUUFC.ZIP

All packages can be found on ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu
(You may also try http://www.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu).

Change to the `emx' directory, do "make" and get emx\cvs.exe.  Assuming
you have edited the `install_dir' variable in the Makefile, you may type
"make install-cvs" to put cvs.exe in the right place.  You may also "make
clean-cvs" to clean up object and library files.

The cvs.exe generated will require emx.dll to run.  You can try
compiling with -Zomf -Zsys to generate a cvs.exe without this
requirement, but I'm not sure whether that works yet (if it does work,
it almost surely would be for client not local, as EMX in this mode
lacks fork()).

You will get warnings during the compilation; ignore them.
