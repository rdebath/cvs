CVS for OS/2
based on EMX 0.9c (patch 02)


This port requires EMX 0.9c (patch 02) and the BSD libraries. It should
work in local mode, in client mode and also in server mode. Server mode
will only work if the client uses the :server: method, because the CRLF
handling of IBM's RSHD.EXE is not "compatible" with CVS. (If you find a
better rshd for OS/2, please let me know!)

To compile CVS for OS/2, you must install the following packages:

 - EMX 0.9c (patch 02) and the GNU-C-Compiler

      EMXDEV1.ZIP
      EMXDEV2.ZIP
      EMXRT.ZIP
      GNUDEV1.ZIP
      GNUDEV2.ZIP
      BSDDEV.ZIP
      EMXFIX02.ZIP

 - GNU make for OS/2

      GNUMAKE.ZIP

 - ufc.a (ufc-crypt) as a replacement for crypt (this my be something
   different if you live inside the USA)

      GNUUFC.ZIP

All packages can be found on ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu
(You may also try http://www.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu).

Change to the `emx' directory, do "make" and get emx\cvs.exe. Assuming
you have edited the `install_dir' variable in the Makefile, you may type
"make install-cvs" to put cvs.exe in the right place. You may also "make
clean-cvs" to clean up object and library files.

You will get warnings during the compilation; ignore them.
