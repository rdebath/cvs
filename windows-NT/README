	           Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
		    ported to Microsoft Windows NT
			   Cyclic Software

Check the ../INSTALL file for information on the most recent version
of CVS which has been known to be tested with NT.  Most of the
following is from Sunday, August 20, 1995 and pertains to the
so-called "1.5nt" release (which is later than 1.5; it is not an
unmodified CVS 1.5), but all the changes done for it had been merged
into 1.6.

The port implements the full set of CVS commands, but cannot access
repositories located on the local machine.  The repository must live
on another machine (a Unix box, say) which runs a complete port of
CVS.

We don't distribute a .ZIP source distribution partly because, as far
as I can tell, PKZIP insists on munging long file names, which would
confuse the makefile for Visual C++.

To compile, use Microsoft Visual C++ on the file cvsnt.mak in the
distribution's top directory.  We haven't tested it under any other
development environments.  If you're curious, see below about the
warnings you may encounter.

Send bug reports to bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu.

This port passes the test in src/sanity.sh.  (We ran the checks by
hand, since we couldn't find a port of the Bourne shell good enough to
execute the script).  Sanity.sh provides pretty minimal feature
coverage, but still gives me some confidence it isn't totally broken.

You will also need GNU patch installed on your system.  GZIP is useful
but not required.  The Congruent ports of these packages to Windows
NT, binary and source, are available in:

	ftp://microlib.cc.utexas.edu/microlib/nt/gnu

Now, strictly speaking, I don't *know* that this port won't correctly
access repositories on the local machine.  I haven't tried it.  I
have put calls to abort in places I'm pretty sure are wrong.  If you'd
like to finish it off and post patches, Morten Hindsholm's port of CVS
1.4A2 to Windows NT might be helpful; it is available as

	ftp://ftp.digex.net/pub/access/schueman/cvs/cvsnt14b.zip



I get the following warnings when compiling this port of CVS 1.5 under
Microsoft Visual C++.  They are all harmless.

- main.c: This is a very weird warning message!  If you understand
  what it's trying to say, let me know:
	'void (__cdecl *)(void)' differs in parameter lists from
	'void (__cdecl *)(void )'
  Okay, whatever, man.
- sighandle.c: These are harmless conflicts in the arguments of
  pointed-to functions.  You're welcome to submit patches for them.
- regex.c: These are signed/unsigned comparison conflicts.  I am not
  going to *touch* this code. :-) I got my fill of it when I was
  hacking GNU Emacs.
