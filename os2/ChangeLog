Fri Nov 10 14:21:14 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * threads.c: new file.

Wed Nov  8 11:14:46 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * run.c: include <stdarg.h> and <stdio.h>.
        Change all VA_START to va_start.
        Don't ask HAVE_VPRINTF -- this is an OS/2-specific file and we can
        take things for granted.
        Started simplifying old NT `HANDLE' code.
        
        * Makefile.in (OS2_SOURCES): added run.c.

        * run.c: new file, copied from ../windows-NT/run.c.  Started
        making changes for OS/2.

        * test-makefile (all): don't bother to echo $CFLAGS; we can just
        read the compilation command.

        * filesubr.c (unlink_file): make this work on OS/2.
        (unlink_file_dir): don't ask if errno == EISDIR.  We ain't
        got EISDIR in OS/2.
        (deep_remove_dir): use EACCESS to determine if directory
        nonempty.  We ain't got ENOTEMPTY in OS/2.
        (that_swing): removed references.  We ain't got that_swing in
        OS/2.
        (rename_file): just use unlink_file(); move to after definition of
        unlink_file() so we don't have to deal with IBM C/C++'s strange
        prototyping rituals.
        (link_file): removed this function -- no one uses it anymore.
        It still exists in src/filesubr.c, though.
        (OS2_filename_classes): new table (well, old table, new name).
        All references changed.

        * config.h (HAVE_SYS_UTIME_H): define to 1.

        * options.h: undef SETXID_SUPPORT, to correspond with Norbert
        Kiesel's recent change to ../src/options.h.in, etc.

Mon Nov  6 16:29:00 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * test-makefile (CFLAGS): -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -- this turns out to be
        important for stuff in lib/.
        Other trivial changes.

        * config.h (HAVE_DIRENT_H): define to 1, now that we have our own
        dirent.h and dirent.c.

        * Makefile.in (OS2_SOURCES): added filesubr.c; this may not be
        permanent.

Sun Nov  5 16:17:33 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (OS2_HEADERS, OS2_SOURCES): added dirent.h and
        dirent.c, respectively.

        * dirent.c, dirent.h: new files.

Sat Oct 28 14:41:38 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (DISTFILES): include `test-makefile'.

        * test-makefile: new file; to be removed when the port is done.

Fri Oct 27 13:03:28 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (OS2_HEADERS, OS2_SOURCES): adjust as necessary for
        below changes.

        * config.h: oops, don't forget second argument, MODE.

        * mkdir.c (os2_mkdir): new file, new function.
        Can probably be merged with wnt_mkdir at some point.

        * config.h (ALLOCA_IN_STDLIB): new #define.

        * pwd.h, pwd.c: new files (for now, copied from ../windows-NT
        directory.  We'll modify/merge them as necessary.)

        * config.h: don't use __stdcall in declaration of gethostname().

        * Makefile.in (DISTFILES): include config.h and options.h.

Wed Oct 25 12:52:54 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * config.h: new file; will maintain by hand.
        Made first pass through to cast it into OS/2-ish condition.
        
        * Makefile.in: started adding lots of OS/2 gunk.
        Took out autoconf stuff; just don't want to fool around with that
        until after it compiles on beezley.
        (cvs.exe): moved this rule to bottom.

Tue Oct 24 13:51:05 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in: add autoconf variables

	* Makefile.in (dist): use $(srcdir)

Mon Oct 23 17:37:36 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (clean): new rule.

        * init os2 directory.  Made dummy Makefile.in, README.
