Words and expressions hard to translate:

- branch
  'ramo'. should the 'galho' too, but in the documentation I'm using
  just 'ramo'.

- check out
  If you think in 'check out' as the opposite of 'check in', then we
  should translate as 'pegar emprestado', as the opposite of
  'devolver'. This is open question.

- commit
  I think that 'efetivar' is good. But people don't like. And some
  people are using commitar (argh!)

- non-branch
  translate to 'não-ramo' is not natural in portuguese. There is any
  problem in translate to 'tronco'

- update
  'atualizar'
