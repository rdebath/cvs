	* Added support for zlib (and Gzip-stream compression) to both the PPC and
     68k ports.

Mon Jul 15 11:53:41 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* For the 68k port, setup memory allocation differently in order to keep the
	   heap and stack from colliding in large recursive operations.  The 68k and PPC
	   versions now both allocate 128k to the stack.

Tues Jun 25 09:26:32 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Removed the requirement for the 'services' file; it only needs to be there
     if you want to use a non-standard port.

Mon Jun 24 10:12:17 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Fixed bug in NoLineBuffer that sent an AE for every character in certain CVS
     modes (e.g. help).
	* Fixed bug in 68K port that didn't set the HLE flag in the size resource

Thurs Jun 7 18:11:43 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* MacCVS fixes inserted into the "mainstream" CVS sources - thanks, Jim!
	* Fixed bug with reading log information from a file

Thurs Jun 6 16:09:03 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Improved MacCVS builds by moving the maccvs.rsrc information to maccvs.r
	* Fixed bug where MacCVS would crash if an error was encountered and
     output was going to AppleEvents or a file

Thurs Jun 6 12:38:54 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Fixed bug keeping CRLF conversion code from getting called
	* Modified "file results" code to use an intermediate file, and to
     rename that file to the requested filename when complete.

Tue Jun 4 13:58:01 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* CVS Code base updated to cvs-1.8.2 (5/27/96 snapshot)
	* Updated to CodeWarrier 9.  The SIOUX redirection stuff is broken under
     CW9.  Using MSL seems promising, but MSL's ccommand is broken.
  * Redid the 680x0 port.

Fri May 16 14:54:21 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* CVS Code base updated to cvs-1.8.2 (5/16/96 snapshot)
	* Bugs in macos_filesys.c related to relative pathnames fixed

Fri May 1 15:58:41 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Added AppleEvents support (undocumented)

Fri Feb 9 11:26:32 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* CVS Code base updated to cvs-1.7

Wed Jan 10 11:40:32 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* CVS Code base updated to cvs-1.6.5 1/8/95 snapshot

Fri Dec 27 14:20:12 1995  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Cleanup of rcmd code, removing inappropriate tests
	* CVS Code base updated to cvs-1.6.3 12/27/95 snapshot
	* Again fixed(?) binary/text file handling.
	* OT problem traced to GUSI - OT bug.  Corresponding with Matthias.

Fri Dec 08 12:39:22 1995  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Fixed problem with 'stat' emulation
	* Used better GUSI resource template so file type/creator was available

Thurs Dec 07 16:13:09 1995  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Port cleanup for inclusion into main cvs distribution
	* Fixed(?) binary file handling
	* Better SIOUX feedback
	* Updates only via whole files (no '-u' to update)

Wed Nov  29 09:33:16 1995  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* Initial port of CVS 1.6.1 snapshot 11/14/95
	* Requires CW GUSI 1.6.4 and CodeWarrier 7
	* 68k version is essentially untested, due to lack of a 68k machine
	* 'release' doesn't work, due to cvs implementation approach
	* Tons of obvious "TODOs", but at least the heavy stuff is done
