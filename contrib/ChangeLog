	* rcs2log: rcs2log was originally in this tree; how did it get
	deleted?  Anyway, this is the version distributed with Emacs
	19.28, hacked to support CVS and Remote CVS.

	* rcs-to-cvs: Don't source .cshrc or hardcode paths.
	Make respository dir if needed.  Don't suppress errors
	(such as prompts) from co.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.
