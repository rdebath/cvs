        * README: new file.

        * Added ChangeLog (this file).
        
        * Added subdir elib.  Filled it with contents of
        `ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz'.
        We will not actively maintain elib here, in the sense of fixing
        bugs, but will try to keep it up-to-date with the latest
        releases.
