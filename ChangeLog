Fri Apr 28 22:31:26 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Brought up-to-date.
	(dist): Rewritten to use dist-dir targets, passing DISTDIR variable.
	(GZIP, GZIP_EXT): New variables.
	(dist-dir): New target.

	We don't want to include a file the user has to edit in the
	distribution.
	* src/options.h: No longer distributed.
	* src/options.h.in: Distribute this instead.
	* INSTALL, README: Installation instructions updated.

Sat Apr  8 19:02:21 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@baalperazim.frob.com>

	* configure.in: Check for fchdir.  
	(connect check): Use AC_CHECK_LIB instead of (obsolete)
 	AC_HAVE_LIBRARY.

Sat Apr  8 14:52:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure set the default for CFLAGS.
	Under GCC, we want -g -O.

Wed Feb  8 06:49:49 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (stamp-h): Pass CONFIG_FILES=$@ to config.status so
 	the target is created.
	* configure.in: Applied `autoupdate' from Autoconf 2.1 to
 	modernize macro usage.
	(AC_RSH): Call removed.  It was obsolete and not doing anything useful.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Write stamp-h as the Makefile rules expect we will.
	(AC_TYPE_PID_T): Add this check.

Tue Nov  8 06:26:54 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

Tue Sep 27 01:03:59 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Don't include LIBS or CFLAGS twice.

	to AC_HAVE_FUNCS.  Check for krb.h and -lkrb.  If not found, look

	HAVE_KERBEROS and also look for -ldes.  Substitute includeopt.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri Mar 11 13:11:51 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)
