Wed Jul 12 16:00:27 1995 Karl Fogel <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (install-local): added rule for install-info, made
        `install' depend on it.

        * README: correct mailing list addresses.
        * INSTALL: same.

Wed Jul 12 09:15:02 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (gdiff_path): Remove gdiff from the list of programs.
	SGI's Irix includes a program named gdiff that is an X-based GUI to
	diff.

	* configure.in: Add check for working fnmatch functions so that
	systems providing it don't incur the space overhead of linking
	with the version in lib.  Cross compiling builds always use the
	version in lib.

Tue Jul 11 15:47:20 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

        * configure.in: add some FIXME comments
	- add a hack to restore src/options.h if AC_OUTPUT() didn't modify
        it. Note that this does *not* work for config.status, thus one
        FIXME comment.
        - add test for #! (to warn about possible failure of perl scripts
	- add test for diff and grep paths (for src/options.h.in)
	- fix up handling of src/options.h.in
	- add checks for PERL_PATH and CSH_PATH (from previous local changes)

Tue Jul 11 14:31:18 1995  Michael Shields  <shields@tembel.org>

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS): Pick up from configure.

Sun Jul  9 19:03:00 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* configure: re-ran autoconf-2.4

	* cvsinit.sh: make use of xVERSIONx from the Makefile
	- get rid of stuff duplicated in examples/* and use that instead

	* Makefile.in: $(VERSION) for cvsinit.sh wasn't set, so get it
        from src/version.c instead.

	* cvsinit.sh: install two more example CVSROOT control/config
        files: rcstemplate checkoutlist
	- install useful scripts from $CVSLIB/contrib too...
	(from previous local changes)

	* Makefile.in: add another reminder to run 'cvsinit' to update
        repository(ies) (from previous local changes)
        
Thu Jul  6 17:53:55 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean-local): Remove $(PROGS).

Sat Jul  1 13:11:41 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.5.1.

Thu Jun 29 01:02:09 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, configure: cross_compiling gets set to "no", not
	empty--change test accordingly.

	* Version 1.4.93.

Wed Jun 28 22:33:54 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* lib/Makefile.in, man/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in: Comment out
	rules for configure and config.status, just like in Makefile.in or
	src/Makefile.in.

Tue Jun 27 19:53:05 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS), configure: Remove fnmatch.
	* lib/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Add fnmatch.
	Avoids buggy Solaris 2.4 libc fnmatch.

	* FAQ: Updated with new version from ftp.odi.com.

Mon Jun 26 15:17:46 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.4.92.

Thu Jun 22 12:45:24 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.4.91.

Wed Jun 21 16:33:04 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* PROJECTS: New file.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add it.

Wed Jun 21 16:12:14 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Don't pass INSTALL to sub-makes.
	The reason for passing it is gone now that we are using autoconf
	2.x which will set INSTALL in the sub-makefiles correctly.

Tue Jun 20 18:14:54 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Make sure src directory exists before
	trying to copy options.h to it.

Mon Jun 19 13:47:20 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add a "remotecheck" target here, for consistency;
	people shouldn't have to switch to src before running the tests.

Mon Jun 19 10:08:03 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* INSTALL: Update list of machines tested.  Remove note about
	systems missing opendir--this is an autoconf issue, not something
	installers should have to worry about.  Refer to NEWS instead of
	ChangeLog.  No longer "strongly recommend" putting diff -a in
	options.h.

Fri Jun 16 22:30:03 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* Version 1.4.90.

	* configure, configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add config/pcl-cvs/Makefile.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Rename dist from ccvs-<version> to cvs-<version>.

	* Makefile.in (dist, dist-dir), src/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	examples/Makefile.in, contrib/Makefile.in,
	contrib/pcl-cvs/Makefile, man/Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in
	(dist-dir): Use srcdir where appropriate.

Thu Jun 15 14:33:37 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* CYCLIC-CVS-FAQ: Removed.
	* Rename ChangeLog.fsf to NEWS.  Add information about changes
	since 1.4A2.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Adjust accordingly.
	* README: Revise to reflect current status of releases.

Thu Jun 15 12:22:42 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* TODO: Remove various items already fixed.  Revise others.

Thu Jun 15 12:24:45 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Use AC_C_INLINE to handle inline.
	Reorganized to put compiler and OS checks first so that any
	special defines they might provide are used in subsequent tests.

	* configure, config.h.in: regenerated with autoconf and
	autoheader version 2.3.

Thu Jun  8 16:33:51 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* INSTALL (Installation): Disrecommend RCS 5.6.[5-7].

Tue May 30 00:07:15 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (distclean-local): Don't delete config.status here.
	(distclean): Delete config.status here instead, but only after
	recursive make invocations.  Otherwise, the new dependencies
	in */Makefile.in on ../config.status led to failure in each sub-make
	because there is no rule there to make ../config.status.
	Reported by Jeff Johnson <jbj@brewster.jbj.org>.
	(realclean): Likewise.

Mon May 29 22:24:28 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Use AC_HEADER_DIRENT instead of AC_DIR_HEADER.
	Use AC_HEADER_STAT to determine if S_FOO() macros work.  
	Use AC_HEADER_TIME to determine if both <sys/time.h> and <time.h> 
	can be included as recommend by autoconf manual.
	Remove AC_STRUCT_TM test, as above test is better.

	* configure, config.h.in: regenerated with autoconf and
	autoheader version 2.3.

Fri Apr 28 14:36:49 1995  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Set "all" as default target instead of ".PHONY".
	Some versions of make will otherwise try building all of the phony
	targets, in order.

Mon May  1 14:02:42 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* configure.in: Set up src/options.h for the user.  Its defaults are
	usually right.
	* README, INSTALL: Adjust installation instructions appropriately.

Fri Apr 28 22:31:26 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Brought up-to-date.
	(dist): Rewritten to use dist-dir targets, passing DISTDIR variable.
	(GZIP, GZIP_EXT): New variables.
	(dist-dir): New target.

	We don't want to include a file the user has to edit in the
	distribution.
	* src/options.h: No longer distributed.
	* src/options.h.in: Distribute this instead.
	* INSTALL, README: Installation instructions updated.

Sat Apr  8 19:02:21 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@baalperazim.frob.com>

	* configure.in: Check for fchdir.  
	(connect check): Use AC_CHECK_LIB instead of (obsolete)
 	AC_HAVE_LIBRARY.

Sat Apr  8 14:52:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure set the default for CFLAGS.
	Under GCC, we want -g -O.

Wed Feb  8 06:49:49 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (stamp-h): Pass CONFIG_FILES=$@ to config.status so
 	the target is created.
	* configure.in: Applied `autoupdate' from Autoconf 2.1 to
 	modernize macro usage.
	(AC_RSH): Call removed.  It was obsolete and not doing anything useful.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Write stamp-h as the Makefile rules expect we will.
	(AC_TYPE_PID_T): Add this check.

Tue Nov  8 06:26:54 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Add stamp-h.in.  Remove it from .cvsignore.

Fri Oct 28 11:50:51 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Comment out autoconf and autoheader rules.

Tue Oct 25 17:44:13 1994  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (all, install, uninstall): Fail if make in
	subdirectory fails.

Tue Oct 18 13:26:15 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Pass INSTALL*.  Add comment about
	why we need to.

Tue Sep 27 08:27:06 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Reinstate "contrib".
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add contrib/Makefile.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Tue Sep 27 01:03:59 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS):  Comment out "contrib".  Since we don't
	bother to configure it, we shouldn't make it either.

Wed Aug 10 14:52:57 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Don't include LIBS or CFLAGS twice.

	* configure.in: Include waitpid and memmove in AC_REPLACE_FUNCS
	list.  Don't check for memmove separately.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* config.h.in: Regenerated for Mark's change.

Wed Aug 10 14:32:24 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in (KRB4): recognize --with-krb4=path. Also test for
	krb_get_err_text so src/main.c and src/client.c can deal
	appropriately.

Tue Aug  9 15:49:07 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check sizes of `long' and `int', needed for md5
	code.
	* acconfig.h: New file.  Mention HAVE_KERBEROS, to keep autoheader
	happy.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.

Tue Jul 19 11:23:21 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check not only that krb.h exists, but that it will
	actually compile correctly.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Jul 11 07:04:36 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Add comment re autoheader.

Tue Jun 28 22:09:23 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Only look for -lsocket and -lnsl if we don't
	already have connect.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Jun 27 17:21:48 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Correct "krb_libdir" to "${krb_libdir}".
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri Jun  3 10:15:24 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check for -lsocket and -lnsl.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri May 27 18:12:43 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Add valloc to AC_REPLACE_FUNCS.  Add getpagesize
	to AC_HAVE_FUNCS.  Check for krb.h and -lkrb.  If not found, look
	in /usr/kerberos if native.  If found somewhere, define
	HAVE_KERBEROS and also look for -ldes.  Substitute includeopt.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri Mar 11 13:11:51 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check for <sys/select.h>; used by src/server.c.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Jan  9 12:04:15 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check for timezone function, for NetBSD support.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Wed Dec 15 18:05:21 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo@andros.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: add MAKEINFO to MDEFINES, pass down MDEFINES on all
	  recursive make invocations that require it; define
	  INSTALL_PROGRAM and use it; reorganize MDEFINES; set infodir and
	  add to MDEFINES; use YACC instead of BISON


Mon Dec  6 17:02:18 1993  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@sendai.cygnus.com)

	* src/diff.c (diff_fileproc): add support for "cvs diff -N" which
	  allows for adding or removing files via patches.
