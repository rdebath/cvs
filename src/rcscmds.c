/* This file, rcs.h, and rcs.c, are intended to define our interface
   to RCS files.  There is only one place outside this file that execs
   RCS commands directly--admin.c.  The intended long-term direction
   is to have CVS access RCS files via an RCS library (rcs.c can be
   considered a start at one), for performance, cleanliness (CVS has
   some awful hacks to work around RCS behaviors which don't make
   sense for CVS), installation hassles, ease of implementing the CVS
   server (I don't think that the output-out-of-order bug can be
   completely fixed as long as CVS calls RCS), and perhaps other
   reasons.

   Whether there will also be a version of RCS which uses this
   library, or whether the library will be packaged for uses beyond
   CVS or RCS (many people would like such a thing) is an open
   question.  Some considerations:

   1.  An RCS library for CVS must have the capabilities of the
   existing CVS code which accesses RCS files.  In particular, simple
   approaches will often be slow.

   2.  An RCS library should not use the code from the current RCS
   (5.7 and its ancestors).  The code has many problems.  Too few
   comments, too many layers of abstraction, too many global variables
   (the correct number for a library is zero), too much intricately
   interwoven functionality, and too many clever hacks.  Paul Eggert,
   the current RCS maintainer, agrees.

   3.  More work needs to be done in terms of separating out the RCS
   library from the rest of CVS (for example, cvs_output should be
   replaced by a callback, and the declarations should be centralized
   into rcs.h, and probably other such cleanups).

   4.  To be useful for RCS and perhaps for other uses, the library
   may need features beyond those needed by CVS.

   5.  Any changes to the RCS file format *must* be compatible.  Many,
   many tools (not just CVS and RCS) can at least import this format.
   RCS and CVS must preserve the current ability to import/export it
   (preferably improved--magic branches are currently a roadblock).
   See doc/RCSFILES in the CVS distribution for documentation of this
   file format.

   On a related note, see the comments at diff_exec, later in this file,
   for more on a diff library.  */

   OPTIONS controls keyword expansion, as a string starting with "-k",

   against; it must be non-NULL.  If REV2 is non-NULL, compare REV1
   and REV2; if REV2 is NULL compare REV1 with the file in the working
   directory, whose name is WORKFILE.  LABEL1 and LABEL2 are default

   DIFF.  The comments in options.h.in regarding the selection of
   a diff program need some revision, but I don't see a big
   issue here.  Another issue (which probably is an issue with or without
   changes to DIFF vs. rcsdiff), is what timezone is used for the dates
   which appear in the diff output.  rcsdiff uses the -z flag, which is not
   presently processed by CVS diff, but I'm not sure exactly how hard to worry
   about this--any such features are undocumented in the context
   of CVS, and I'm not sure how important to users.  */

/* Show differences between two files.  This is the start of a diff library.

   Some issues:

   * Should option parsing be part of the library or the caller?  The
   former allows the library to add options without changing the callers,
   but it causes various problems.  One is that something like --brief really
   wants special handling in CVS, and probably the caller should retain
   some flexibility in this area.  Another is online help (the library could
   have some feature for providing help, but how does that interact with
   the help provided by the caller directly?).  Another is that as things
   stand currently, there is no separate namespace for diff options versus
   "cvs diff" options like -l (that is, if the library adds an option which
   conflicts with a CVS option, it is trouble).

   * This isn't required for a first-cut diff library, but if there
   would be a way for the caller to specify the timestamps that appear
   in the diffs (rather than the library getting them from the files),
   that would clean up the kludgy utime() calls in patch.c.

   Show differences between FILE1 and FILE2.  Either one can be
   DEVNULL to indicate a nonexistent file (same as an empty file
   currently, I suspect, but that may be an issue in and of itself).
   OPTIONS is a list of diff options, or "" if none.  At a minimum,
   CVS expects that -c (update.c, patch.c) and -n (update.c) will be
   supported.  Other options, like -u, --speed-large-files, &c, will
   be specified if the user specified them.

   OUT is a filename to send the diffs to, or RUN_TTY to send them to
   stdout.  Error messages go to stderr.  Return value is 0 for
   success, -1 for a failure which set errno, 1 for success (and some
   differences were found), or >1 for a failure which printed a
   message on stderr.  */
