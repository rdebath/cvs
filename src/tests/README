This test suite currently requires the development version of Autoconf with a
patch you can get from Derek Price <derek@ximbiot.com> to be regenerated.  The
distributed Bourne shell script should still be useful to those who simply want
to test their system and do not need to alter the test suite.

To run from this directory:

	$ ./suite AUTOTEST_PATH=src

To run from any directory with a working cvs or to get the first cvs in PATH:

	$ suite

For more info:

	$ suite --help
