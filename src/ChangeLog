Fri Feb  9 00:46:47 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* rcs.c (RCS_reparsercsfile): Remove unused variable date.

	* myndbm.c (mydbm_load_file): Fix typo ('015' -> '\015').

Thu Feb  8 13:00:00 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* rcs.c (RCS_parse, RCS_parsercsfile, RCS_reparsercsfile),
	fileattr.c (fileattr_read), myndbm.c (myndbm_open):
	Use FOPEN_BINARY_READ.
	* fileattr.c (fileattr_write), myndbm.c (myndbm_close):
	Use FOPEN_BINARY_WRITE.
	* history.c (history_write, read_hrecs): Specify OPEN_BINARY.
	* rcs.c: Remove calls to abort.
	* myndbm.c (myndbm_load_file): Ignore CRs from ends of lines
	if present.
	* myndbm.c, fileattr.c: While I am at it, change \n to \012
	a few places where LF is intended.
	* history.c (history_write): Use getenv ("HOME"), not getpwnam,
	to find home directory.  If it isn't set, just keep going; don't
	print a message.
	* rcscmds.c, cvs.h (RCS_checkout): New function.
	* update.c, checkin.c, commit.c, diff.c, import.c, no_diff.c, 
	patch.c: Call it instead of run_*.
	* patch.c (patch_fileproc): Clean up inconsistent handling of
	noexec flag.
	* rcscmds.c (RCS_*): Pass -x,v/ to RCS commands; elsewhere in
	CVS it is assumed that ,v is a suffix.

Fri Feb  2 14:07:32 1996  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* rcs.h (struct rcsnode): Remove dates field (list of rcsversnodes
 	indexed by date).  CVS maintained this list for each RCS file even
	though it was never used.  This resulted in higher then necessary 
	memory requirements (and run time too).  Even if revision info was
	needed, CVS' List data structure is inappropriate because can't
	handle duplicate keys.  The above was discovered by tracking down
	a memory leak.
	* rcs.c (RCS_reparsercsfile): Don't build dates list.
	(freercsnode): Don't delete dates list.
	(rcsvers_delproc): Free date field.
	(null_delproc): Removed.
	
Thu Feb  1 12:28:33 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* remove.c (cvsremove): Don't tell user the name of the program
	which they use to remove files; we don't have any way of knowing
	that, and besides which they might use a GUI or emacs 'dired' anyway.
	* update.c (update_filesdone_proc, update_dirleave_proc): Call
	unlink_file_dir instead of rm -rf.
	* options.h.in: Remove RM; no longer used.

	* sanity.sh: New tests devcom-a* test "cvs watch add",
	"cvs watch remove", and "cvs watchers".

	* sanity.sh: New test 171a0 tests for watch.c bug just fixed by kfogel.

	* Most .c files: Remove rcsids.
	* cvs.h: Remove USE macro.

Thu Feb  1 13:07:15 1996  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* tag.c, rtag.c: Update various comments to reflect function name
 	changes.

Thu Feb  1 14:14:31 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * recurse.c (do_recursion): comment #endif.

        * edit.c (notify_check): surround with #ifdef CLIENT_SUPPORT; else
        CVS won't compile if CLIENT_SUPPORT is undefined.
        
        * edit.h (notify_check): surround declaration with #ifdef
        CLIENT_SUPPORT.

        * watch.c (watch): if argc <= 1, then just give usage (previously
        was "argc == -1").

Thu Feb  1 12:28:33 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README-rm-add: Remove information which is now in cvs.texinfo.

	* sanity.sh: Remove basic0 tests.  Move a few to new tests
	basica-1a* (but there is no need to test that *every* command
	gracefully does nothing on an empty directory; exhaustive testing
	is impractical and the generic recursion processor handles this
	anyway).

	* sanity.sh: New tests 69a* test use of update -p to restore old
	version of dead file.

Wed Jan 31 18:32:34 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* ChangeLog-9395: Remove duplicate entries from 1996 which
	accidentally got into this file.

	* client.c (read_line, read_from_server): Change "premature end of
	file from server" message to "end of file from server (consult
	above messages if any)" because 99% of the time it means rsh has
	printed an error message and exited.

Wed Jan 31 15:09:51 1996  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* edit.c (ncheck_fileproc): Fix memory leak; free line before
	returning.

Tue Jan 30 18:06:12 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* recurse.c (do_recursion): Add comment about the fact that we
	don't have locks in place at certain points.

Tue Jan 30 09:43:34 1996  Vince Demarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* edit.c (notify_proc): have notify_proc call expand_path with
	the name of the filter program. The user may have used a
	cvs environmental variable. (Popen will expand it, but it may not
	use the correct value)

Tue Jan 30 09:43:34 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* ChangeLog: take the pre-1996 changes and put them in a new file
	ChangeLog-9395.
	* ChangeLog-9194: Renamed from ChangeLog.fsf.
	* ChangeLog-9194, ChangeLog-9395, ChangeLog: Add additional text
	explaining the difference between all these logs and pointing to
	older logs.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add ChangeLog-9194 and ChangeLog-9395;
	remove ChangeLog.fsf.

	* modules.c (do_module): Don't fall through from 'l' to 'o' case
	of option processing switch statement.

Tue Jan 30 06:50:19 1996  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* client.c (send_repository): Fix memory leak; free adm_name
 	before returning.
	* diff.c (diff_file_nodiff): Fix memory leak; free xvers before
 	returning.
	* rtag.c (rtag_fileproc): Fix memory leak; if branch_mode is set,
 	free rev before returning.
	* status.c (status_fileproc, tag_list_proc): Fix memory leak; free
 	return value of RCS_whatbranch.
	* tag.c (tag_fileproc): Fix memory leak; free vers before
 	returning.
	(val_fileproc): Fix memory leak; free return value of RCS_gettag.
	* watch.c (watch_modify_watchers): Fix memory leak; free mynewattr
	before returning.

Tue Jan 30 09:43:34 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* lock.c (readers_exist): If stat gave an error, print an error
	message saying it was from stat, rather than from "reading
	directory".  Skip the message completely if it was an
	existence_error.

	* sanity.sh (branches): New tests (branches off of branches, etc.).

Tue Jan 30 11:55:34 MET 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* main.c (main): Add change to run getopt_long twice again.

Mon Jan 29 15:59:31 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	gcc -Wall lint:
	* client.c: Include edit.h

Sun Jan 28 09:45:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* edit.c, edit.h (mark_up_to_date): New function, to remove file
	in CVS/Base.
	* client.c (update_entries): Call it if file is up to date.
	* checkin.c (Checkin): Call it in non-server (local) case.
	* sanity.sh: New test 182.5, tests for above-fixed bug.

Sun Jan 28 01:07:22 1996  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@beezley)

	* client.c (change_mode): Separate out CHMOD_BROKEN code to parse
	mode_string, rather than going through a mode_t.  Cleaner than
	the previous CHMOD_BROKEN code (which also had a typo of && not &).

Sat Jan 27 23:29:46 1996  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@beezley)

	* edit.c (edit_fileproc): Check for EACCESS as well as EEXIST.

Sat Jan 27 16:26:30 1996  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * client.c (notified_a_file): use rename_file() instead of
        rename() (but temporarily set `noexec' to 0 so it runs
        unconditionally).
        (change_mode): deal with CHMOD_BROKEN.        

Fri Jan 26 00:14:00 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * server.c: renamed `dirname' to `dir_name', to avoid conflicts
        with system headers.

        * client.c: renamed `dirname' and `last_dirname' to `dir_name' and
        last_dir_name' (see above).  Not strictly necessary, but
        consistency is nice -- as long as you do it all the time.

Thu Jan 25 00:41:59 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * options.h.in (AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT, AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT): change
        comment now that no longer under construction.

Wed Jan 24 15:25:22 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.7.1.

	* Version 1.7.

Sat Jan 20 00:05:08 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.6.87.

Mon Jan 15 18:14:55 1996  Gary Oberbrunner  <garyo@avs.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* tag.c (val_direntproc):  New function to ignore
	  nonexistent dirs when recursing to check tag validity.
	  (tag_check_valid): Pass it to start_recursion.
	* sanity.sh (death): New tests 65a0-65a6 cause test 74 to test for
	above-fixed bug.

Mon Jan 15 12:55:37 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* main.c: Revert change to run getopt_long twice.  This can go in
	after 1.7.

Mon Jan 15 13:03:28 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* filesubr.c (deep_remove_dir): added test of EEXIST for nonempty
	  directory (Posix states that both ENOTEMPTY (BSD) and EEXIST
	  (SYSV) are valid)

	* main.c (main): run getopt_long twice to allow command-line
	  suppression of reading the cvsrc file

Fri Jan 12 10:02:43 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.6.86.

Thu Jan 11 23:28:05 1996  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* fileattr.h (fileattr_startdir): Add comment about REPOS == NULL.
	* fileattr.c (fileattr_read, fileattr_write): Assert that
	fileattr_stored_repos != NULL.
	(fileattr_free): If fileattr_stored_repos is NULL, don't free it.

Thu Jan 11 18:03:21 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * scramble.c (descramble): deal with DIAGNOSTIC better.

Thu Jan 11 12:04:42 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* main.c: remove CVS_NOADMIN.

	* options.h.in: remove CVS_NOADMIN

Thu Jan 11 10:28:44 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * scramble.c (descramble): make sure the string returned is safe
        to free().

Wed Jan 10 01:11:23 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* server.c (serve_notify): Cast return value from malloc.

	* edit.c (notify_do): Use struct assignment, not struct
	initialization (which SunOS4 /bin/cc doesn't have).

Tue Jan  9 09:41:29 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.6.85.

	We use version numbers instead of patchlevels.  But there was some
	confusing patchlevel stuff lying around.  Nuke it:
	* Makefile.in (HEADERS): Remove patchlevel.h
	* patchlevel.h: Removed.
	* main.c: Don't include patchlevel.h.
	(main): Don't print patch level.

	* server.c (check_repository_password): Check for errors from
	system calls; reindent function.

Tue Jan  9 23:15:30 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * expand_path.c: fix comments (explain expand_path()'s behavior
        correctly).

Tue Jan  9 09:41:29 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* edit.c (notify_proc): After copying in string following %s,
	don't clobber it.  Instead set up q to end of string.

	* watch.c (watch_modify_watchers), edit.c (editor_set): Fix sense
	of test in trying to decide whether attributes are changed.

	* cvs.h (CVSROOTADM_USERS): New macro.
	* edit.c (notify_do): Look up notifyee in CVSROOTADM_USERS if it
	exists.

Tue Jan  9 21:39:45 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * expand_path.c: don't redundantly #include things that cvs.h
        already #includes (i.e., stdio.h, ctype.h, string[s].h).

Tue Jan  9 09:41:29 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* ignore.c (ign_default): Add *.obj.

	* server.c: Put /* */ around #endif comment.

Mon Jan  8 20:37:17 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * client.c (connect_to_pserver): check return value of recv().

Mon Jan  8 11:37:57 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* client.c (connect_to_pserver): Check for error from connect;
	reindent function.

	* sanity.sh (4.75): Use dotest, so we get a PASS if test passes.

	* sanity.sh (dotest): New argument OUTPUT2.
	(188a): Use it instead of \|.

	* sanity.sh (import): Avoid using string $ followed by Id followed
	by $ in sanity.sh source, in case sanity.sh itself is under CVS.
	I hate keyword expansion.

	* sanity.sh: If expr cannot handle multiline expressions, fail and
	tell the user to get one which can.

	* release.c (release_delete): Remove unused variable retcode.

Fri Jan  5 13:30:00 1996  Jim Kingdon   <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* release.c (release_delete): Call unlink_file_dir rather 
	than "rm -rf".

Thu Jan  4 09:58:30 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* commit.c (find_fileproc): Print "nothing known about foo" and
	return 1 if the file doesn't exist and isn't in CVS/Entries.
	(commit): If the recursion over find_fileproc returns an error,
	print "correct above errors first!" just like local CVS.
	* sanity.sh (basica): Test for above-fixed bug.

	* release.c (release): If we are the client, only unedit if the
	server supports it.

	* sanity.sh: Remove STARTANCHOR stuff; expr patterns are
	automatically anchored to the start.  ENDANCHOR remains.

	* commit.c (commit): Don't start the server until we have
	determined that there is something to commit.

Thu Jan  4 09:48:33 1996  Ben Laurie  <ben@gonzo.ben.algroup.co.uk>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* client.c (start_server): dup the file descriptor before
	fdopening it.

Wed Jan  3 18:25:25 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* sanity.sh: Remove tests 5, 5.5, and 5.75.  All that stuff is
	tested elsewhere.

	* ignore.c (ign_default): Change CVS* to CVS CVS.adm.  CVS* is too
	broad, especially in a case-insensitive filesystem.

	* Makefile.in (cvsbug): version.c is in srcdir.

Wed Jan  3 17:30:45 1996  Phi-Long Tran  <ptran@autodesk.com>

	* modules.c (do_module): Honor error_use_protocol in printing trace.
	* server.c (server_register): Move check for options NULL to above
	printing of the trace.

Wed Jan  3 01:19:53 1996  Mark Immel <immel@centerline.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* update.c (checkout_file): Do not resurrect file on join if it
	doesn't contain the revisions we are joining.  Probably not a
	perfect test, but should be an improvement.
	* sanity.sh (death): New death-file4-* tests, for bug fixed above.

Wed Jan  3 01:19:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* add.c, admin.c, checkout.c, client.c, commit.c, diff.c, edit.c,
	history.c, import.c, log.c, patch.c, release.c, remove.c, rtag.c,
	status.c, tag.c, update.c, watch.c: In calling send_to_server,
	pass \012 not \n.  On the Mac \n is CR, not LF, and we want to
	send LF.  I didn't try to deal with whether files in CVSADM should
	contain CR or LF--in fact there is some code in client.c which
	reads \n from CVSADM files and passes it to send_to_server; it
	needs to be cleaned up one way or the other.

	* entries.c (Entries_Open): Don't try to close fpin twice.

	* client.c (update_entries): Fix typo ("strlen (filename + 10)"
	-> "strlen (filename) + 10").

	* commit.c (checkaddfile): Remove arbitrary limit.

Tue Jan  2 11:25:22 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* commit.c (commit): Only pass files which were modified, added,
	or removed to send_file_names.  This has as a side effect a
	semantic change--the up-to-date check is now skipped for other
	files--but probably a good one, or at least not a bad one.
	* sanity.sh (basica): New test; tests for bug fixed above.
	* sanity.sh (187a3): Adjust for new 'cvs commit' output.  Set up
	DOTSTAR to match arbitrary text (another GNU expr bug/misfeature,
	sigh).

	* sanity.sh: Test that the commit in test 43 actually worked.
	Merge tests basic2 and basic3 and make them independent of basic1.
	(pass,fail): Don't insert spurious space.
	(45.5): Fix typo in directory name.

Tue Jan  2 13:00:00 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	Visual C++ lint:
	* myndbm.c: Prototype write_item.

Tue Jan  2 11:25:22 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	gcc -Wall lint:
	* client.c (client_expand_modules): Pass error message not "" to error.
	* client.c (supported_request), server.c (supported_response):
	Return a value (gcc -Wall can't know that error doesn't return).
	* commit.c (copy_ulist): Return a value.
	* history.c (fill_hrec): Don't make assumptions about whether
	time_t is "int" or "long" or what.
	* cvs.h: Declare link_file.
	* server.c: Include fileattr.h.
	* server.c (server_notify): Remove unused variable val.
	* tag.c (val_fileproc): Remove unused variable foundtag.

Mon Jan  1 09:49:16 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.6.5.

	* Version 1.6.4.

	* filesubr.c (link_file): Add comment about link vs. copy semantics.

	* cvs.h (struct vers_ts): Fix comments.
	* commit.c (commit): Before we ask for a log message, figure out
	what is modified and what is not and pass the information to
	do_editor.
	(copy_ulist,find_fileproc): New helper functions for above code.

	* client.c (read_line): When writing to from_server_logfile, write
	the \n too.

	* client.c (send_files): No longer call send_file_names.
	* client.h: Update comment.
	* add.c, admin.c, commit.c, diff.c, edit.c, log.c, remove.c,
	status.c, tag.c, update.c, watch.c: Call send_file_names before
	send_files.
	* client.c: New variables module_argc, module_argv.
	(client_expand_modules): Set them, to arguments.
	(client_send_expansions): Use them instead of modules_vector to
	send arguments.
	* sanity.sh (modules): Add test of modules -d flag.
