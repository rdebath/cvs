Low-priority bugs go here.  Actually, most every documented bug is
"low-priority"--in the sense that if it is documented it means noone
has gotten around to fixing it.


* If a ~/CVS/Root file exists on the server and you are using rsh to
connect to the server, CVS may loose its mind (this was reported in
May 1995 and I suspect the symptoms have changed, but I have no
particular reason to think the bug is fixed -kingdon, Sep 96).

* (Jeff Johnson <jbj@jbj.org>)
  I tried a "cvs status -v" and received the following:

  ? CVS
  ? programs/CVS
  ? tests/CVS
  cvs server: Examining .
  ===================================================================
  File: Install.dec            Status: Up-to-date
  ...
  
  I claim that CVS dirs should be ignored.
  (I don't *think* this always happens; is "-I !" getting picked up somewhere
  something like that? -kingdon, Sep 96)

* On remote checkout, files don't have the right time/date stamps in
  the CVS/Entries files.  Doesn't look like the C/S protocol has any
  way to send this information along (according to cvsclient.texi).
  Perhaps we can spiff it up a bit by using the conflict field for the
  stamp on the checkout/update command.  Please note that this really
  doesn't do very much for us even if we get it done.

* Does the function that lists the available modules in the repository
  belong under the "checkout" function?  Perhaps it is more logically
  grouped with the "history" function or we should create a new "info"
  function?
