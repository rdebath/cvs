Low-priority bugs go here.  We don't have many yet -- everything is
high-priority at the moment. :-)


* I sometimes get this message:

  Could not look up address for your host.  Permission denied.
  cvs [update aborted]: premature end of file from server

  The client's response should be cleaned up.

* In the gb-grep module, update-ChangeLog (and therefore, I assume,
  rcs2log) truncates file names --- I get entries for things called
  ring/lenstring.h instead of lenstring/lenstring.h.

* On remote checkout, files don't have the right time/date stamps in
  the CVS/Entries files.  Doesn't look like the C/S protocol has any
  way to send this information along (according to cvsclient.texi).
  Perhaps we can spiff it up a bit by using the conflict field for the
  stamp on the checkout/update command.  Please note that this really
  doesn't do very much for us even if we get it done.

* Does the function that lists the available modules in the repository
  belong under the "checkout" function?  Perhaps it is more logically
  grouped with the "history" function or we should create a new "info"
  function?
