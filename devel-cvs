The CVS Developers' List <devel-cvs@cyclic.com> exists to help people
with access to the CVS source repository co-ordinate changes, make
releases, and administer the repository.

The membership of devel-cvs should be exactly those people who have
been given access to the repository for the CVS sources.

The devel-cvs list may be used to discuss:
- administrivia regarding the CVS source repository and release
  process, and
- changes and features intended for inclusion in the official CVS
  release (either source code or documentation), which someone plans
  to implement, or has implemented.

The devel-cvs list should not be used to discuss:
- changes or features to packages other than the CVS release
  (e.g., related packages like tkCVS, RAD/CVS, or other groups'
  distributions of CVS, like RCVS, etc.),
- changes which nobody has offered to implement, or
- the philosophy of CVS (as opposed to a specific change to CVS).
These topics should either go on info-cvs, or have a new mailing list
created for them.

The topic restrictions in this charter do not reflect the development
group's future plans for CVS; rather, they reflect a topic
classification which the group finds helpful.

Procedure for dealing with people who want to be developers:

People who want checkin access (checkout-only access is available only
via snapshots, for technical reasons) are first requested to send
patches and have them reviewed by a developer.  If they submit some
good ones (preferably over a period of time, to demonstrate sustained
interest), then one of the developers can ask the devel-cvs mailing
list whether it is OK to make this person a developer.  If there are
no objections, an account will be created.
