Mon May 29 22:32:40 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* system.h: Handle time and directory headers as recommended in
	the autoconf manual.
	Undefine the S_FOO() macros if STAT_MACROS_BROKEN is set.
	Don't define mode_t, as it is handled by config.h.

Sat May 27 08:46:00 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Regenerate only Makefile in current
	directory when Makefile.in is out of date.  Depend on ../config.status.

Fri Apr 28 22:49:25 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): Updated.
	(HEADERS): New variable.
	(DISTFILES): Updated.
	(dist-dir): Renamed from dist; changed to work with DISTDIR
	variable passed from parent.

Wed Feb  8 06:37:53 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* system.h (S_IRUSR et al): Define if not already defined.

	* waitpid.c [HAVE_CONFIG_H]: Include "config.h".
	(ualloc): Return OLDPTR rather than running off the end.

Mon Aug 22 22:48:19 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* error.c (strerror): Replaced conditional static definition
	(always used, since the condition variable was never set) with an
	extern declaration, since it's provided by libc or strerror.c.

Wed Aug 10 14:54:25 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add waitpid.c.
	* waitpid.c: New file.

Tue Aug  9 16:00:12 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h (uint32): If SIZEOF_LONG isn't 4, don't define this to be
	"unsigned long"; try SIZEOF_INT and "unsigned int", otherwise
	complain.

	* md5.c: Include config.h.
	(const): Don't bother defining here, config.h should take care of
	it.

	* valloc.c (malloc): Declare.

Fri Jul 15 12:57:20 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* getopt.c: Do not include <stdlib.h> unless __GNU_LIBRARY__ is
	defined.  On Irix 5.2, <stdlib.h> includes <getopt.h>, which
	causes a multiple definition of struct option.

Fri Jul  8 10:04:59 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h, md5.c: Remove ANSI-isms.

Thu Jul  7 20:24:18 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h, md5.c: New files.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add md5.c.
	(OBJECTS): Add md5.o.
	(DISTFILES): Add md5.h.
	(md5.o): New target; depend upon md5.h.

Fri May 27 18:15:34 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* valloc.c: New file.

Tue May 17 08:18:26 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* error.c (error, fperror): If server_active, call server_cleanup
	as well as Lock_Cleanup.

Thu Jan  6 13:45:04 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* system.h: Fix Dec 27 change to work correctly.  Makes Sep 9
	change unnecessary, so backed that one out.  Never define PATH_MAX
	in terms of pathconf, because that doesn't produce a constant, and
	PATH_MAX is used to set array sizes.

Mon Dec 27 14:22:07 1993  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* system.h: don't touch PATH_MAX or MAXPATHLEN if *both* of them
	are already defined, as one may be defined in terms of the other.
