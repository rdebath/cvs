* What is Remote CVS?

Remote CVS is a variant of CVS able to access repositories on remote
machines.  This is amazingly helpful when collaborating on a project
with someone across a long-haul network.

Features include:
- uses reliable transport, i.e. no NFS!  NFS is unusable over long
  distances (and sometimes over short distances)
- transfers only those files that have changed in the repository or
  the working directory; sometimes only transfers patches; can
  compress data for transmission
- never holds CVS locks while waiting for communication with client,
  making it robust over flaky networks

Remote CVS was written by the talented folks at Cygnus Support
<info@cygnus.com>, but they can't spare the time to support it or
distribute it themselves.  They don't want bug reports or questions.
Instead, send those to the remote-cvs mailing list, described below.


* Aren't there other similar CVS hacks out there?

There have been several CVS variants designed with similar goals.
contrib/pcl-cvs/pcl-cvs.el mentions one or two, for example.  However,
I've had a hard time finding more information about those
implementations, so I can't comment on them.  Are they better?  Worse?
Do they have the same name?  Let me know!


* How can I get Remote CVS?

If you'd like to try this implementation out, it's available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.cyclic.com, as /pub/cvs/cvs.tar.gz.  The
mailing list remote-cvs@cyclic.com has been set up to handle bug
reports and questions; send mail to remote-cvs-request@cyclic.com to
subscribe or unsubscribe.

Nota bene:
- It has not tested or ported much, with all that that entails ---
  bugs, portability problems, documentation inconsistencies.
- I can't promise any support for it.  If you need it, get in touch
  with me; maybe we can work something out.
- Nevertheless, please send all bug reports to remote-cvs@cyclic.com.
  Most people on the info-cvs mailing list probably won't be able to
  fix them (since they don't use the package).


If you are a good hacker, and want to participate in Remote CVS's
development, there's a better way to get started.  For this to work,
you have to have an account on totoro.cyclic.com, and the ability to
rsh to it.  You need to be in the `cvs' group, too.  Send me mail if
you need an account or need to be added to the `cvs' group.

Retrieve the file /pub/cvs/bootstrap-cvs.tar.gz from ftp.cyclic.com.
Unpack it, configure, and build Remote CVS.  Now, since that tar file
contains all the version management info CVS needs, you can use the
tar file you just unpacked as your working tree, and use the
executable you just built to check out the latest version of its own
source.  Go to the top directory of the distribution and type
"./src/cvs update".


* Where are the remote features documented?

Check out doc/cvsclient.texi in the Remote CVS distribution.  Would
you like to update the main doc file, cvs.texinfo to describe Remote
CVS's features?
