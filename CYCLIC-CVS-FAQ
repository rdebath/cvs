* What is Cyclic CVS?

Cyclic CVS is a branch from version 1.4A2 of the original CVS
distribution, with further bug fixes and speedups installed, in
addition to the remote repository access features.

Cyclic CVS can access repositories on remote machines.  This is very
helpful when collaborating on a project with someone across a
wide-area network.

Here are some of the features of the remote implementation:
- It uses reliable transport protocols (TCP/IP) for remote repository
  access, not NFS.  NFS is unusable over long distances (and sometimes
  over short distances)
- It transfers only those files that have changed in the repository or
  the working directory.  To save transmission time, it will transfer
  patches when appropriate, and can compress data for transmission.
- The server never holds CVS locks while waiting for a reply from the client;
  this makes the system robust when used over flaky networks.

Cyclic CVS can also be used locally, like other CVS versions, if you
have no need for remote access.


* How do I get up-to-date information and information about other
versions of CVS?

On the web, http://www.winternet.com/~zoo/cvs/ or
http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html.  Also see the Cyclic CVS
mailing list mentioned below.


* How can I get Cyclic CVS?

If you'd like to try this implementation out, it's available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.cyclic.com, as /pub/cvs/ccvs.tar.gz.  The
mailing list cyclic-cvs@cyclic.com has been set up to handle bug
reports and questions; send mail to cyclic-cvs-request@cyclic.com to
subscribe or unsubscribe.

Nota bene:
- It has not tested or ported much, with all that that entails ---
  bugs, portability problems, documentation inconsistencies.
- I can't promise any support for it for free.  If you're interested
  in a support or development contract, send me mail and we'll work
  something out.
- Nevertheless, please send all bug reports to cyclic-cvs@cyclic.com.
  Most people on the info-cvs mailing list probably won't be able to
  fix them (since they don't use the package).


* Where are the remote features documented?

Check out doc/cvsclient.texi in the Cyclic CVS distribution.  Would
you like to update the main doc file, cvs.texinfo to describe Cyclic
CVS's features?
