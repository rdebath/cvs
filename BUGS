* We don't understand the relationship between modules and subdirs
  very well.  However, it is certainly the case that

          CVSROOT=<local-cvs-repository> cvs checkout cvs

                        and

          CVSROOT=<remote-cvs-repository> cvs checkout cvs

        ought to produce the same dir tree, and they don't.  On floss,
checking out cvs gets cygnus/cvs/..., whereas on totoro it gets
cvs/... bad, bad, bad, Bad, BAD.


* Partly because of the above problem, there is a name confusion.  We
  are maintaining a cvs tree, which to remote updaters appears as a
  subdir of cygnus/, when in fact we are neither cygnus nor the
  standard disty of cvs.  If possible, we should fix the above bug and
  rename the tree to "rcvs", what say?


* Is it still the case that cvs tries to use Perl and fails, so that
  installers need to fix by hand the line in
  $repository/CVSROOT/loginfo to read:

  DEFAULT       (echo ""; echo $USER; date; cat) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog

  If so, we ought to either make it work as intended or take out the
  attempted Perl entirely.
